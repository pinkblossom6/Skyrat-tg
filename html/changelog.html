Color adapters can be colored, but they'll still connect two pipes with different colors. BUILDABLE machines are GREY (thermomachines, cryo, HFR) so be aware of this add:-Trying to go across another smart pipe will now build a bridge pipe automatically already colored of the color you choose, so you don't have to place it yourself anymore (is still available in the RPD tho) add:-ALL binary components, layer manifolds, color adapters and bridge pipe can be put ONTOP of a smart pipe, but not on another of these. Smart pipes can't be placed on top of these pipes, so you have to build them first. add:-Lcrossings can't be made anymore (sorry y'all i tryed, if someone have a way of doing them ping me on discord) add:-REMEMBER you still have 5 layers to go, these rules apply to the same layer pipes, so if you do a crossing on different layers you won't see a bridge pipe appear.</li>
